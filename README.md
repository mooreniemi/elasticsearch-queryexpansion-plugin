# Rocchio expansion for ElasticSearch

This is a prototype plugin for ElasticSearch 5.x to add Rocchio-based query expansion support using BM25 similarity. This plugin adds an ``_expand`` REST endpoint to ElasticSearch that returns a "[query string query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html)" with Lucene-style terms weights. This plugin was developed as part of the  NDS [bioCADDIE pilot](https://biocaddie.org/expansion-models-biomedical-data-search).

## Why Rocchio
Our original goal was to implement relevance model (RM) based expansion using Lucene's language modeling similarity implementations. Our investigations revealed that [Lucene's language modeling implementation is incomplete](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5847) and may not be suitable for use with RM. Given Lucene's origins as a vector-space implementation and current default BM25 scorer, we opted to instead implement Rocchio-style expansion. While Rocchio expansion was not originally intended for use with the BM25 retrieval model, it has proven effective.

## REST Interface

Endpoint:  
``/index/_expand``

Parameters:
* ``type``: Document type, defaults to ``dataset``
* ``field``: Field to search, defaults to ``_all`` (which is deprecated as of ES 6, but [can be reenabled](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.4/mapping-all-field.html#enabling-all-field))
* ``alpha``: Original query weight, defaults to 0.5
* ``beta``: Feedback query weight, defaults to 0.5
* ``k1``: BM25 k1 parameter, defaults to 1.2
* ``b``: BM25 b parameter, defaults to 0.75
* ``fbDocs``: Number of feedback documents, defaults to 10
* ``fbTerms``: Number of feedback terms, defaults to 10
* ``stoplist``: Additional stoplist terms (modifies primary stoplist)
* ``query``:  Query to expand

The expand endpoint returns a JSON object with the expanded query in "[query string query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html)" format with each expansion term and the associated expansion weight:
```
{
    "query":  "term1^weight1 term2^weight2 ..."
}
```

This query can be used with the standard ElasticSeach ``_search`` endpoint:
```
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/biocaddie/_search?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
    "query": {
        "query_string" : {
            "default_field" : "_all",
            "query" : "term1^weight1 term2^weight2"
        }
    }
}
'
```





## Prerequisites

* ElasticSearch 5.3.2 (native or via Docker)
* Git + Maven (native or via Docker)
* ElasticSearch index

## Installing from OSSRH
You can install the plugin using the following command:
```bash
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/edu/illinois/lis/queryexpansion/5.3.2-SNAPSHOT/queryexpansion-5.3.2-20170726.231658-1.zip
```

NOTE: You can check https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/edu/illinois/lis/queryexpansion/5.3.2-SNAPSHOT for a link to the newest `.zip` file.

## Building From Source
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone nds-org/elasticsearch-queryexpansion-plugin queryexpansion && cd queryexpansion 
mvn package
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install file:///path/to/elasticsearch-queryexpansion-plugin/target/releases/queryexpansion-5.3.2-SNAPSHOT.zip
```


##  Example usage

The repository includes several scripts demonstrating how to install and use the plugin via Docker:

1. [Setup](README.md#setup)
2. [Build](README.md#build)
3. [Load](README.md#load)
4. [Test](README.md#test)

### Setup
The following steps demonstrate how to build an ElasticSearch index from the bioCADDIE test collection.

Make sure that the biocaddie benchmark test dataset exists somewhere on disk:
```bash
cd $HOME
wget https://biocaddie.org/sites/default/files/update_json_folder.zip && unzip update_json_folder.zip
```

Start ElasticSearch or run ElasticSearch 5.3.2 via Docker using the helper script:
```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

Create an index with the required parameters (store==true):
```bash
./scripts/create-index.sh
```

NOTE: You may need to modify *dataset_path* in `./scripts/add-docs.sh` if your benchmark data is not located within `$HOME`.

Finally, use the helper script to add the documents to the index:
```bash
./scripts/add-docs.sh
```

NOTE: Indexing the full benchmark set can take a long time. If you only need a small subset of the documents, you can always `Ctrl+C` once you get the desired number of records indexed.

### Build
The following helper script will build the plugin using Maven (or using Docker if Maven is not installed):
```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```
Either way, the build should produce a `target/releases/` directory with the necessary `.zip` file.

The `.zip` that ElasticSearch needs should be found at `./target/releases/rocchio-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

### Load
Once the artifacts are built, we just need to install them and restart ElasticSearch. The following helper scripts assume that you are running ElasticSearch via Docker:
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
./scripts/restart.sh
```

### Test
You should now be able to test the new endpoint using the helper script or via raw `curl`:
```bash
$ ./test.sh
{"query":"sclerosis^2.798773920190095 study^0.4716440174771813 disease^0.584064093901503 or^0.3394485958568884 patients^0.79730633189081 multiple^1.941784058395449 was^0.4222225922753828 is^0.38702376034952857 to^0.4432445617796595 on^0.3817563584164061"}
```

You can check the container logs to see what happened under the covers:
```bash
$ ./logs.sh
